# __Code.Position__: StandardImplementation
# Reading the Raw Directories

# These classes are used to navigate directories for various purposes.

# _Notice_:
# This class will be modified to reflect any change in standards about how the file
# tree is reflected, and will remain a standard implementation where one could use
# optimized version. We want to always provide the "open source" functionality of
# having somewhere to start their own projects.

# Notice: we won't break the filenames and folder names, thus we won't check about
# their formats.

# == Imports
#
# Import "os" and "pathlib" for filesystem and file name access.

import os
import pathlib

# Import anytree to provide structured view.

# tree must be visible for Open Source, and more or less human/AI-readable.
# We might teach AI to answer with creative Q&A pairs, given such comment
# and the code, thus it could be "Wiki-connected" to have Open Wiki where
# each can add their corrections, version number and / or cache of the version
# of original page; through which they refer to original version in Git, which
# should be a root folder of Spider's reflection: it's a good Spider, which knows
# it's own sites, but relatively exensible to espacially Markdown servings, but
# also HTML for example you can convert it to Markdown, and keep the tags and
# additional references, like XML. I think you can configure some converters
# or especially, AI can show where to add hooks into open source conversion
# libraries, where you need to support their Licence terms and agree to something
# where CC, GPL and probably MIT should be all compatible with my original idea, as
# scientist or programmer or usomething like university user or "hacker" as GPL
# community calls themselves not "literally" might need them for their needs.

#
# === Agile plan:
#
# We might implement caching and other handling in later versions, where we need to
# optimize - tree.md locations could be cached and the API for the filesystem built
# by other means; files could be watched and their changes noticed. Database could
# be used. The result would be accessible via Anytree, and that's what we are interested
# in: we implement this interface on a low-optimum basis. Let's hope that file tree
# cache works and hard drive is still read once :)
#
# One we update to faster version, the simpler should be maintained as an implementation
# example, where we are interested in keeping the "open source" terms in access to minimal,
# readable and usable version, which can be optimized later as well.
#
# Notice that there are multiple ways of how this could be optimized: perhaps, we would
# implement different ways and create AI cards so that an AI would learn to build this
# system in multiple manners; for example some people would turn off tree.md mapping
# an put their code mostly into a subfolder or have other, separate function to map
# it somewhere. I think this could be achieved even in Apache, directly.
#
# Because we are creating a common standard for Laegna documentations: in case it would
# become a community effort at all, we would have multiple implementations of this format.
